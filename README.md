## 🚀 The VahanSetu Solution

VahanSetu provides a unified platform for the three pillars of the EV economy:

### 1. 🚛 Fleet Logistics & Dashboard
- **Battery Forensics**: Real-time monitoring of cell voltages, temperature, and SOC (State of Charge).
- **Health Scores**: AI-driven reliability metrics for every vehicle in the fleet.
- **Neural Route Intelligence**: OSRM-based routing with corridor geofencing and automatic charging stop insertion.

### 2. ⚡ Charging Point Operations (CPO)
- **Vahan Intelligence Engine**: Simulates hardware pings (OCPP) to provide real-time bay availability.
- **Predictive Pricing**: Dynamic cost multipliers based on grid load and time-of-use (ToU) forecasts.
- **Network Uptime**: 99.8% simulated reliability with automatic node decommission protocols.

### 3. 👤 End-User Experience
- **JWT Nexus Security**: Session-isolated authentication with secure cookie persistence.
- **Carbon Marketplace**: Convert charging efficiency into tradeable carbon credits.
- **VahanPay**: Integrated payment simulation for frictionless energy transfers.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### 🛡️ Backend Protocol
- **Core**: Python / Flask (Production-hardened with Gunicorn)
- **Persistence**: SQLite with **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** for high-concurrency telemetry updates.
- **Security**: HS256 JWT Authentication, Password Hashing (Werkzeug), and CSRF-safe session tokens.
- **Intelligence**: Background threading for real-time grid simulation and predictive pricing calculations.

### 🎨 Frontend Protocol
- **Core**: React 18 / Vite (Lightning-fast HMR)
- **UI System**: Custom "Cyber-Navy" Glassmorphism design using Vanilla CSS.
- **Visuals**: Lucide Icons for high-fidelity asset representation.
- **Analytics**: Chart.js integration for real-time energy consumption and revenue trends.

## 🔧 Installation & Local Setup

### 1. Unified Environment
We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate VahanSetu's dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zeelkundariya/vahansetu.git
cd vahansetu

# Backend Setup
cd vahansetu
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 2. Client Development
```bash
cd vahansetu/client
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (Flask handles both API and React proxying).

## ☁️ Deployment Configuration (Render)

VahanSetu is optimized for one-click deployment on Render.

| Parameter | Configuration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Service Type** | Web Service |
| **Environment** | Python |
| **Build Command** | `./build.sh` |
| **Start Command** | `gunicorn --chdir vahansetu app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT` |
| **Health Check** | `/health` |

---

## 🛡️ Security & Performance
- **Environment Isolation**: Uses `python-dotenv` for managing secure keys.
- **Diagnostic API**: Visit `/health` to verify database connectivity and frontend integrity.
- **Emergency Fallback**: The UI includes a safety net that serves high-fidelity demo data if the primary database node is inaccessible.
